Howdy fellow netizen, welcome to my silly repo. This is my attempt at making a neofetch clone. It is very simple, and does not display ASCII art. You can run the program by first making it executable with "chmod +x trogfetch", then running the script with ./trogfetch. Have fun!

Try something like 'ip a | grep inet' that should work better than 'hostname -i'
